### What I learned

I learned how to add filter color for images.

```css
.card-image-box {
  width: 100%;
  height: 300px;
  background-color: #8622c9;
}

.card-image {
  width: 100%;
  height: 300px;
  filter: opacity(0.55);
}
```

```

```

### Continued development

I would hope to work on my CSS Grid and flexbox skills.
